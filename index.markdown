Hello! I am a Research Fellow at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/) working under Professor [Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato](jcsuarez.com). I'm a member of the [Stanford Initiative for Business, Taxation, and Society (STAX)](https://stax.stanford.edu/), which conducts cross-disciplinary tax research to better inform practice, policy, and academia.

I graduated from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) in May 2025 with majors in Government and the [College Scholar Program](https://as.cornell.edu/education/college-scholar-program). For my honors thesis, I studied why citizens tolerate democratic backsliding even as they prefer democracy to other systems of government, using data from the Arab Barometer, Afro Barometer, and Latinobarómetro. I also worked as a research assistant to Professor [Vida Maralani](https://vidamaralani.net/) and the [LDI Replication Lab](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/ldi-replication-lab), supervised by the AEA Data Editor.
