    <p>Hello! I am a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/">Stanford Graduate School of Business</a> working under Professor <a href="http://jcsuarez.com">Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato</a>. I'm a member of the <a href="https://stax.stanford.edu/">Stanford Initiative for Business, Taxation, and Society (STAX)</a>, which conducts cross-disciplinary tax research to better inform practice, policy, and academia.</p>

    <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> in May 2025 with majors in Government and the <a href="https://as.cornell.edu/education/college-scholar-program">College Scholar Program</a>. For my honors thesis, I studied why citizens tolerate democratic backsliding even as they prefer democracy to other systems of government, using data from the Arab Barometer, Afro Barometer, and Latinobarómetro. I also worked as a research assistant to Professor <a href="https://vidamaralani.net/">Vida Maralani</a> and the <a href="https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/labor-dynamics-institute/ldi-replication-lab">LDI Replication Lab</a>, supervised by the AEA Data Editor.</p>
